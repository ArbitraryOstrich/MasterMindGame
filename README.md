This is an attempt at making the game called mastermind. The point of the game is to make guesses recieve information back from the system about that guess and iterate until you have the correct answer. The trick is desiging a question that can be asked in this narrow range which gives the most information in the clearest way, that is to say, the answer can't be misunderstood..

Eventually I would like to codify my personal strategy into code and test it vs various naive stragies.

I also wanted to try out the MVC pattern so you can see me porting previous game logic over.
